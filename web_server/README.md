About Inginx : Type: NGINX is an open-source web server and also serves as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy, and HTTP cache.
Origin: It was created by Igor Sysoev and first publicly released in 2004.
Purpose: Initially developed to solve the C10k problem, which relates to handling a large number of concurrent connections.
Features
Performance: Known for its high performance, stability, simple configuration, and low resource usage.
Asynchronous Architecture: NGINX uses an asynchronous, event-driven architecture which enables it to manage multiple connections on a single thread.
Reverse Proxy: It can act as a reverse proxy server for HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, POP3, and IMAP protocols, as well as a load balancer and an HTTP cache.
Load Balancing: Supports various load balancing methods like round-robin, least connections, and IP-hash.
Configuration
Configuration Files: NGINX configurations are stored in text files (usually found in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf).
Flexibility: Offers a flexible configuration syntax and supports a modular architecture. It allows additional functionality through modules.
Rewrite Rules: Capable of URL rewriting, which is useful for redirecting URLs and controlling traffic.
Security
SSL/TLS Support: Provides built-in support for SSL and TLS for secure connections.
Buffer Overflow Protections: Designed to prevent buffer overflows, a common vulnerability in web servers.
Authentication Methods: Supports different types of authentication including basic HTTP authentication and others through external modules.
Use Cases
Static Content: Efficient at serving static content with its ability to handle a large number of connections simultaneously.
Proxy Server: Commonly used as a reverse proxy for load balancing among multiple application servers.
Microservices Architecture: Fits well in microservices architecture due to its lightweight and ability to handle service discovery and routing.
Community and Support
Versions: There are two versions available: NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus (commercial version with additional features).
Documentation and Community: Has extensive documentation and a strong community support system.
Differences from Apache
Performance: Generally, NGINX is known for better performance, especially in handling static content and high concurrency.
Architecture: Unlike Apache's process-driven architecture, NGINX uses an asynchronous, event-driven model.
Configuration: NGINX configuration tends to be simpler and more straightforward compared to Apache.
Deployment
Platforms: It can be deployed on various operating systems including Linux, Windows, macOS.
Installation: Installation procedures vary based on the operating system but are generally straightforward, involving package managers or compiling from source.
