strace is a diagnostic, debugging, and instructional userspace utility for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. It is used to monitor interactions between processes and the Linux kernel, which include system calls, signal deliveries, and changes of process state. Here are some key points about strace:

Functionality:

strace intercepts and records the system calls which are called by a process and the signals which are received by a process. System calls are the primary interface between a program and the Linux kernel.
It can display the name of each system call, its arguments, its return value, and the error code (if any).
Common Uses:

Debugging: Understanding the execution flow of a program, especially when source code is not available or the issue is believed to be in the operating system or a third-party library.
Performance Analysis: Identifying system calls that are taking a significant amount of time and could be performance bottlenecks.
Security Analysis: Detecting potentially malicious activities in programs, like unexpected system calls.
Learning Tool: Understanding how different programs interact with the kernel and use system resources.
Basic Usage:

To attach to an already running process: strace -p [PID], where [PID] is the Process ID.
To start a new process under strace: strace [program] [arguments].
To trace a program and follow child processes spawned by fork or clone: strace -f [program].
Output:

The output includes each system call name, its arguments, its return value, and the error code (if the call fails).
For better readability, strace translates system call numbers to names and decodes argument values into human-readable form.
Options and Filtering:

strace provides numerous options to filter and customize the output, such as filtering by specific system calls, limiting the number of traced system calls, or capturing the output to a file.
Time stamps can be added to each line of the trace output to measure the duration of system calls.
Limitations and Considerations:

Tracing a process with strace can significantly slow it down, making strace unsuitable for use in a production environment unless absolutely necessary.
The use of strace requires adequate permissions. To attach to a process, you typically need to be the owner of the process or have root privileges.
Installation:

strace is typically pre-installed on many Linux distributions. If not, it can be easily installed via the package manager (e.g., apt on Debian-based systems, yum on Red Hat-based systems).
strace is a powerful tool for system administrators, developers, and security professionals, offering deep insights into the workings of Linux processes. However, due to its potential to slow down processes and its detailed output, it's primarily used for debugging and troubleshooting, rather than for routine monitoring.
